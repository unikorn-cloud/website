	<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
	<p>
		This is not a managed service, it is a FOSS application, so we do not, and will not, as an entity gather any information about you or your users.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any informantion that is gatherered about your users e.g. Google Groups, is used sorely for functionality purposes e.g. management of RBAC, that are not possible through existing oauth2/OIDC standards.
	</p>

	<h2>Use of Identity Provider Data</h2>

	<p>
		Information is ephemeral where possible, only what is absolutely needed to function is ever stored.
		No information is never transmitted to any 3rd party.
	</p>

	<h3>OpenID Connect</h3>
	<p>
		Email addresses provide a canonical identifier for a user.
		These are used to grant access to resources via RBAC, and provide audit logging.
		Profile data e.g. forename, surname, picture may be used to personalize UX.
	</p>

	<h3>Groups</h3>
	<p>
		Groups are used to provide access to resources via RBAC, and do so by implicitly mapping a user to internal groups and the roles associated with them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Only what is required to function is ever stored e.g. group identifiers.
	</p>
